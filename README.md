**Virtual Pet Simulator**

**Overview:**
The Virtual Pet Simulator is a C++ program designed to simulate the experience of owning and caring for a virtual pet. It offers users the opportunity to select from a variety of pets, including cats, dogs, rabbits, parrots, and tigers. Each pet comes with its own set of unique characteristics and behaviors, providing users with diverse gameplay experiences.

**Features:**

1. **Pet Selection:** Users can choose from a range of pets, each with its own distinct attributes, such as size, temperament, and special abilities. This allows users to select a pet that aligns with their preferences and playstyle.

2. **Interactions:** The program enables users to interact with their chosen pet through various activities, including feeding, playing, and cleaning. These interactions directly impact the pet's well-being and behavior, making it essential for users to monitor and maintain their pet's health and happiness.

3. **Health Monitoring:** Users can monitor their pet's health status, including parameters such as hunger, happiness, and cleanliness. Regular monitoring allows users to identify any issues or changes in their pet's condition and take appropriate actions to address them.

4. **Special Behaviors:** Certain pets, such as the tiger, exhibit special behaviors that add depth and challenge to the gameplay. For example, the tiger may become aggressive or attack under specific conditions, requiring users to adapt their care strategies accordingly.

5. **Random Events:** The program incorporates random events to introduce unpredictability and excitement into the gameplay. These events can range from positive occurrences, such as finding a hidden treasure, to negative events, such as the sudden onset of bad weather or illness.

6. **Game Loop:** The Virtual Pet Simulator operates within a continuous game loop, allowing users to engage with their pet over multiple sessions. This loop enables users to form a bond with their virtual pet over time and experience the progression of their pet's growth and development.

**How to Use:**
1. **Compilation:** Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. **Execution:** Run the compiled executable file.
3. **Pet Selection:** Choose a pet type from the available options.
4. **Name Entry:** Enter a name for your pet.
5. **Gameplay:** Interact with your pet by selecting from feeding, playing, and cleaning options.
6. **Monitoring:** Keep track of your pet's health, happiness, and cleanliness levels to ensure its well-being.
7. **Adaptation:** Adjust your care strategies based on your pet's behaviors and any random events that occur during gameplay.
8. **Quit:** Choose the quit option to exit the game.

By offering a diverse range of pets, interactive gameplay mechanics, and dynamic events, the Virtual Pet Simulator provides users with an immersive and engaging virtual pet ownership experience.
